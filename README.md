This is dummy plugin written in Intellij Idea for my project.

In order to test the plugin you need to have Intellij Idea (Community Edition) installed and set up appropriately.
Detailed steps on how to set up Intellij Idea for plugin testing/development are given here:

http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/setting_up_environment.html

Once you've checked out source code of the plugin you need to configure project to work with Intellij SDK.
How to create Intellij SDK and add it to your project is described in the link above.
